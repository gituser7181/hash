PROCEDURE:
A demilitarized zone(DMZ) is a secure network segment that acts as a buffer between
an organization internal network and the internet.
This provides an additional layer of security for the internal network and protect against
external threats.
 Identify sensitive resources: The first step is to identify the sensitive resources that need
to be protected, such as web servers, email servers, and databases. These resources will
be hosted in the DMZ.
 Plan the network architecture: Determine the location of the DMZ in relation to the
internal network and the Internet. The DMZ should be placed between the internal
network and the Internet to provide a buffer between the sensitive resources and
external threats.

 Create a separate network segment: Set up a separate network segment for the DMZ,
using firewalls or routers to physically separate it from the internal network.
 Configure firewall rules: Configure firewall rules to allow only necessary traffic to
flow between the DMZ and the internal network. This may include allowing incoming
traffic from the Internet to reach the web servers in the DMZ, and allowing the web
servers to communicate with the database servers in the internal network.
 Implement security measures: Implement security measures such as firewalls, intrusion
detection systems, and anti-virus software in the DMZ to protect the sensitive resources
hosted there.
 Monitor and audit the DMZ: Regularly monitor and audit the DMZ to ensure that it is
functioning as expected and to identify any security breaches or potential
vulnerabilities.
 Update the DMZ configuration: Regularly update the DMZ configuration to reflect
changes in the network environment and to maintain a high level of security.
 Host web servers, email servers, and databases: Host the sensitive resources in the
DMZ, including web servers, email servers, and databases.
 Allow incoming traffic and communication: Allow incoming traffic from the Internet
to reach the web servers in the DMZ, and allow communication between the web
servers and the database servers in the internal network.
 Control traffic flow: Ensure that only necessary traffic is allowed to flow between the
DMZ and the internal network. This helps reduce the risk of security breaches and
protects sensitive information.

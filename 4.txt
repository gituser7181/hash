Window patch management is the process of ensuring that the operating system and installed
applications on a computer are up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.
Implementing a patch management policy is an important step in ensuring the security and
stability of a computer system.
 Identify the systems that need to be patched: Determine which computers and servers
need to be included in the patch management process. This may include desktops,
laptops, servers, and other devices running Windows.
 Assess the current patch level: Use tools such as the Windows Update service or thirdparty patch management software to determine the current patch level of each system.
This will help you determine which systems need to be updated and which updates are
required

 Create a patch management plan: Determine the schedule for patching, including when
patches will be installed, how they will be tested, and how they will be rolled out to
production systems. Also, determine the processes and procedures for documenting and
tracking patches.
 Choose a patch management solution: Choose a patch management solution that meets
your needs. This may include using the Windows Update service, a third-party patch
management software, or a combination of both.

 Implement the patch management solution: Install the patch management solution on
each system that needs to be updated. This may include configuring the software to
automatically download and install updates, or it may require manual intervention to
download and install updates.
 Test patches before deploying: Before deploying patches to production systems, it is
important to test them in a test environment to ensure that they do not cause any adverse
effects. This can include testing patches in a virtual machine or on a test server.
 Deploy patches to production systems: Once the patches have been tested, they can be
deployed to production systems. This can be done using automated tools, or it may
require manual intervention.
 Monitor and verify the patch level: Regularly monitor the patch level of each system to
ensure that it is up-to-date. Verify that all necessary updates have been installed and
that there are no missing patches.
 Document patches: Document the patches that have been installed, including the date
they were installed, the version of the patch, and any associated documentation.

 Review and update the patch management policy: Regularly review and update the
patch management policy to ensure that it continues to meet your needs and to reflect
changes in the environment.

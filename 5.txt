PROCEDURE:
Sleuthkit is a powerful open-source toolkit for forensic analysis of computer systems.
It provides a collection of command-line and graphical tools for investigating disk images
and analyzing the contents of file systems. One of the main features of Sleuthkit is its ability
to perform file analysis.
File analysis using Sleuthkit involves examining the contents of files and determining
information about them, such as their type, creation and modification dates, and other
metadata.
 Sleuthkit provides several tools for analyzing individual files, including "istat" and
"fsstat".
 The "istat" command is used to display information about a specific file in a disk image,
such as its inode number, creation and modification dates, and other metadata.

 FILE ANALYSIS USING SLEUTHKIT
16
 The "fsstat" command provides a summary of the contents of a file system, including
information about the number of files, the size of the file system, and the type of file
system.
 Sleuthkit also provides several tools for searching and locating specific files within disk
images, including "fls" and "icat".
 The "fls" command can be used to list the contents of a file system, including
information about each file's inode number, name, type, and size.
 The "icat" command is used to extract the contents of a specific file from a disk image.

 Sleuthkit provides the ability to analyze file types, including support for a variety of
file formats, such as text files, image files, and executable files.
 Sleuthkit includes the "sorter" tool, which can be used to sort files within a disk image
based on various criteria, such as file type, size, or creation date.
 The "tsk_recover" tool can be used to recover deleted files from a disk image.
 Sleuthkit also provides tools for analyzing file metadata, such as timestamps, file
names, and other attributes.
 The "ffind" command can be used to search for files that match specific criteria, such
as file name, creation date, or size.
 Sleuthkit supports the analysis of file slack, which is the unused portion of a file that
can contain valuable information, such as deleted data.
 The "blkls" command can be used to display the contents of the slack space of a file.
 Sleuthkit provides the ability to analyze file system structures, including support for
various file system types, such as NTFS, FAT, and ext2.
 The "fsstat" and "mmls" commands can be used to display information about the
structure of a file system, including the layout of partitions, the number of blocks, and
the size of the file system.
 Sleuthkit also provides support for the analysis of disk images, including the ability to
mount disk images as file systems.
 The "mount_ewf" command can be used to mount a disk image in the EnCase format.
19
 Sleuthkit includes the "tsk_loaddb" command, which can be used to create a database
of the contents of a disk image for faster searching and analysis.
 Sleuthkit provides the ability to perform hash analysis, including support for common
hash algorithms, such as MD5 and SHA-1.
 The "hash_lookup" command can be used to search for files within a disk image that
match a specific hash value.
